## 3. Insta-Insights: Analyzing User Behavior on Instagram with SQL 

Through SQL queries, I analyzed various aspects of a photo-sharing website. I determined the day of the week when most users registered on the site to aid in scheduling ad campaigns. I also identified inactive users who have never posted a photo and suggested targeting them with an email campaign.

To encourage engagement, I ran a contest to see who could get the most likes on a single photo and identified the winner. I calculated the average number of posts per user, ranked users by post count, and determined the total number of users who have posted at least once.

I also investigated the use of hashtags on the site and identified the top five most commonly used hashtags. To address issues with bots and celebrity accounts, I found users who have liked every single photo on the site and those who have never commented on a photo. Additionally, I determined the percentage of users who have either never commented on a photo or have commented on every photo.

Overall, these SQL queries provided valuable insights into user behavior on the photo-sharing website and offered recommendations for improving engagement and addressing potential issues.
