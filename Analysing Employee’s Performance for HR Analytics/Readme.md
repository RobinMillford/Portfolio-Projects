# Analysing Employeeâ€™s Performance for HR Analytics

## Data Pre-processing:
Removed duplicate rows from the dataset.

Removed rows with irrelevant data type values in numeric columns.

Performed validation checks to identify inconsistencies or discrepancies in data types, units, or formats.
## Exported Cleaned Dataset:
Exported the cleaned dataset as a CSV file with UTF-8 encoding.
## SQL Queries:
Provided SQL queries to solve various problem statements based on the given dataset.

The problem statements included tasks like calculating averages, percentages, counts, and identifying top values based on specific conditions.

The SQL queries were written to address each problem statement and provide the desired results.

Overall, I covered data pre-processing techniques using Python and SQL queries to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
The SQL queries addressed a range of scenarios such as aggregating data, grouping by specific criteria, filtering based on conditions, and calculating summary statistics.
