# Work-Related Fatality Study: An In-depth Analysis
I worked on a project related to analyzing work-related fatalities using Python and SQL. Here's a summary of what I accomplished

### Dataset Preparation:
  I reviewed the columns in the dataset related to work-related fatalities.
  I emphasized the importance of data cleaning and removing unnecessary columns for further analysis.

### Analysis:
  I explored various analysis techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas.

### SQL Queries:
  I provided SQL queries to address specific questions, such as calculating the number of reported incidents and identifying the top states with the most fatalities from specific causes (e.g., shootings or stabbings).

### Summary:
  I concluded my work by summarizing the key points discussed and the tasks accomplished during this project.


Through my efforts, I made progress in analyzing work-related fatalities by combining SQL queries and Python programming.
