Data Loading: I started by loading the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas dataframe.

Data Cleaning: I performed various data cleaning tasks to ensure the dataset was accurate and consistent. This included handling missing values by filling them with appropriate values or removing rows with missing values.

Data Exploration: I explored the dataset to gain a better understanding of its structure and content.

Data Manipulation: I manipulated the dataset to extract relevant information and create new variables. I performed tasks such as calculating mean ratings, filling missing values.

Data Cleaning and Saving: I applied additional cleaning steps, such as removing duplicates and irrelevant entries, to ensure the dataset was clean and ready for analysis. I saved the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file for future use.

SQL Queries: In addition to using Python, I utilized SQL queries to solve specific problem statements. These queries allowed me to retrieve information, filter data based on certain conditions, perform calculations, and obtain meaningful insights.

By following these steps, I was able to thoroughly explore, clean, manipulate, and analyze the dataset. This process helped us gain insights, uncover patterns, and prepare the data for further analysis or use in other applications.
