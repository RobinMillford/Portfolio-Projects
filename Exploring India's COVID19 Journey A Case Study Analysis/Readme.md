# Exploring India's COVID-19 Journey: A Case Study Analysis

In this project, I explored India's COVID-19 journey through a series of SQL queries and data analysis. My objective was to gain insights into different aspects of the pandemic using available datasets. Additionally, I utilized Python to perform data cleaning and handle the datasets effectively.

### Data Cleaning
The project began with data cleaning, a crucial step to improve the quality and usability of the data for analysis. I renamed columns in the datasets to ensure consistency and clarity.

### Python Data Manipulation
I also utilized Python to perform data cleaning and manipulation tasks on the datasets.

### Data Analysis with SQL
I formulated SQL queries to address various problem statements and extract meaningful information from the datasets.
#### 1. Analysis of COVID-19 Recovery Rate
I calculated the recovery rate among the states by retrieving the number of recovered and active cases from the 'statewisedata' table.
#### 2. Hospital Bed Availability Analysis
I analyzed the availability of hospital beds in different states, considering the number of beds available and the total population beds from the 'hospitalbeds' table.
#### 3. Total Samples Tested and Positive Cases
I calculated the total number of samples tested, total number of positive cases, and the difference between them using the 'icmrtestingdata' table.

### Summary

This project provided insights into India's COVID-19 journey through data analysis and manipulation. I utilized SQL queries to explore various aspects of the pandemic, such as recovery rates, hospital bed availability, and testing statistics. Additionally, I performed data cleaning and manipulation tasks using Python to ensure data quality and usability.

The combined use of SQL and Python allowed me to gain valuable insights from the datasets, facilitating a comprehensive case study analysis of India's COVID-19 situation.
